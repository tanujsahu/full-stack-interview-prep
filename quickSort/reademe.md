# Quick sort is an efficient, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
        It works by selecting a "pivot" element and partitioning the array into two sub-arrays based on the pivot's value.
        Choose a good pivot to avoid worst-case scenarios.
        Consider using randomization or the median-of-three method to select the pivot.
        Implement in-place partitioning to optimize space usage.
