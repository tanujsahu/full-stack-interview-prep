## What is a Promise?
        Promises are a way to work with asynchronous operations in JavaScript,
        providing a more structured and manageable approach than callbacks.
        They help you write clearer code and handle errors more effectively.


## States of a Promise
# A promise can be in one of three states:

        Pending: The initial state. The promise is neither fulfilled nor rejected.
        Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully, and the promise has a resulting value.
        Rejected: The operation failed, and the promise has a reason for the failure (an error).


## Chaining Promises
        You can easily chain multiple asynchronous operations together
        You can chain multiple promises together, which is especially useful for sequential asynchronous operations:
