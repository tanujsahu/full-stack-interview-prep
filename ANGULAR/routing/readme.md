# What is routing in Angular?

   Answer: Routing is a feature that enables navigation between different views or components in a single-page application. It is managed by the RouterModule.

        Example
        const routes: Routes = [
        { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent },
        { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent },
        ];
