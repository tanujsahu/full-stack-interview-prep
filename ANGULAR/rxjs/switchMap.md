    switchMap is useful when you need to handle situations where only the latest data matters. It helps prevent unnecessary processing and ensures you’re always working with the most current value. If you have more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!


        Example :
        import { of, timer } from 'rxjs';
        import { switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators';

        const source = of('A', 'B', 'C');
        const result = source.pipe(switchMap(val => timer(1000).pipe(map(() => ${val} after 1s))));

        result.subscribe(value => console.log(value)); // Outputs: "A after 1s", then "B after 1s" (C won't be emitted)

    In your example, the reason "C" is not emitted is due to how the switchMap operator works. Let's break it down step by step.

Code Breakdown
Source Observable:

        const source = of('A', 'B', 'C');
        This creates an Observable that emits the values 'A', 'B', and 'C' sequentially.

        Using switchMap:

        javascript
        Copy code
        const result = source.pipe(
        switchMap(val => timer(1000).pipe(map(() => `${val} after 1s`)))
        );


    Here’s what happens:

    When switchMap receives 'A', it starts a timer for 1 second. After 1 second, it will emit "A after 1s".
    When switchMap receives 'B' (after about 1 second), it cancels the timer for 'A' and starts a new timer for 'B'. After 1 second, it will emit "B after 1s".
    When it receives 'C', the same logic applies: it cancels the timer for 'B' and starts a new timer for 'C'.
    Key Point: Cancellation
    Only the Latest Value: switchMap only keeps the most recent Observable. If a new value arrives before the previous Observable (timer) completes, it cancels the previous one.
        
        In this case, by the time 'C' is emitted, the timer for 'B' has already been canceled because the new value ('C') was received.

        After 1 second, "A after 1s" is emitted.
        Shortly after, "B after 1s" is emitted, and "A after 1s" is canceled.
        The timer for 'C' starts, but before it can emit "C after 1s", the timer for 'B' was canceled.
        So, if 'C' is emitted after 'B' (the timer for 'C' is canceled), it won't produce any output.

        Summary
        The behavior you're observing is exactly how switchMap is designed to work: it keeps only the most recent Observable and cancels the previous ones. This makes it ideal for scenarios like user input where only the latest action is relevant. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
