# Callback 
        A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function,
        which is then invoked at a later time. Callbacks are often used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

# Summary
        Callbacks allow you to execute code after an asynchronous operation completes.
        They are fundamental in JavaScript for handling events, network requests, and other asynchronous tasks. However, they can lead to "callback hell" when nested too deeply, which is why promises and async/await have become popular alternatives.
